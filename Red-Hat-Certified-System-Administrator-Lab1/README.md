# Red-Hat-Certified-System-Administrator-Lab1
RHCSA Practice lab
This lab I retrieved from a few outside sources and edited to fit my own needs. If you decide to follow this lab you will need two servers. I will update each file, as well as this readme, as I go to make it a bit more universal.

If you have questions about how to make this compatible with any other RHEL release or any questions in general feel free to reach out to me!

Thanks,
Ariana
